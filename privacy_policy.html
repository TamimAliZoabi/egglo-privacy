    <h1>Privacy Policy for Egglo</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: <strong>2025-12-11</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome — Egglo (the “App”) is developed and published by <strong>Taz Studio</strong> ("we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how we protect it, and your choices regarding that information. By installing or using Egglo you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:tamim.ali.zoabi@gmail.com">tamim.ali.zoabi@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p><strong>Developer / Publisher:</strong> Taz Studio</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>a) Information you provide</h3>
    <p>We do not require you to create an account to play Egglo. If you contact us (for support or feedback), you may provide personal information such as name and email address.</p>

    <h3>b) Automatically collected information</h3>
    <p>When you use the App we may automatically collect certain device and usage information, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID, device model)</li>
      <li>Operating system and OS version</li>
      <li>App usage statistics (e.g., session length, screens viewed)</li>
      <li>Crash reports and diagnostics</li>
      <li>Network/connection information (IP address, carrier)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c) Information collected by third parties</h3>
    <p>The App uses third-party services and SDKs that may collect information — for example advertising networks, analytics, and crash reporting. These third parties collect and process information according to their own privacy policies. Examples of types of third parties commonly used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ad networks and mediation (e.g., Unity Ads, LevelPlay / ironSource, Google AdMob)</li>
      <li>Analytics and performance monitoring (e.g., Unity Analytics, Firebase Analytics, other SDKs)</li>
      <li>Crash reporting (e.g., Unity Cloud Diagnostics / other crash reporters)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note:</em> If you would like exact lists of third parties used in your build, open your built app’s Gradle/manifest and plugin SDK lists or the LevelPlay/ironsource/AdMob dashboard to see current integrations.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver the App and its features</li>
      <li>Personalize and improve gameplay and features</li>
      <li>Analyze usage and diagnose technical issues</li>
      <li>Display personalized or non-personalized ads</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and prevent abuse</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Ads & Monetization</h2>
    <p>Egglo displays advertisements (e.g., rewarded ads, interstitials, banners) delivered by third-party ad networks. These networks may use identifiers (like Advertising ID) and cookies to serve, target, and measure ads. You can opt out of interest-based advertising through your device settings (for Android: Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization).</p>

    <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (If applicable)</h2>
    <p>Where required (e.g., GDPR regions), our legal basis for processing personal data includes consent (when you provide it), legitimate interest (analytics, app improvement), and compliance with legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain data only as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill legitimate business needs (analytics, crash analysis, fraud prevention). Data retention times may vary depending on the type of data and third-party storage policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, and portability of your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:tamim.ali.zoabi@gmail.com">tamim.ali.zoabi@gmail.com</a>. We will respond in accordance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>8. Children</h2>
    <p>Egglo is not directed to children under 13 (or a higher age where required). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the minimum age. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures intended to protect the data we process. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Data collected may be processed and stored in countries outside your own jurisdiction. By using the App you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.</p>

    <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The App may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites — please review their privacy policies before sharing personal information.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as our App and legal obligations change. We will post the revised policy here and update the “Last updated” date.</p>

    <h2>13. How to Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, contact us at: <a href="mailto:tamim.ali.zoabi@gmail.com">tamim.ali.zoabi@gmail.com</a>.</p>
